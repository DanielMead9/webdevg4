website editing: https://www.dimarconsulting.com/consulting  

Our website: https://webdevg4.vercel.app/ 

Home Page: Increased page width and font size to make the page more readable. Added a "go to top" button at the bottom of the page to return the user to the top of the page. Added responsive navigation bar which collapses the navigation bar on mobile devices and small screens which can be shown with the hamburger button and a dark mode toggle next to the hamburger button, which were not present on the original site.

Consulting Page: Reworked the page to have a better layout. Also minimize links to unnecessary pages. There is no functionality of saving a time on the schedule page since that would lead to the back end. 

Schedule Page: Improved the look and functionality of the schedule page and made easier navigation between different types of meetings

Contact Page: Organized contact information including phone numbers, hours, and address and added link to schedule appointments. Contact form includes the ability to choose an interested service. Backend functionality has not been implemented for the contact form.
